Cryptoshadow is a full crypto trader and educator. They are the founder of the
@Tier7Trading group.

**What attracted you to trading?  **

A close friend of mine bought ETH near 10$ (or something insanely low). He got
rich, he told me about it and it sparked my intrigue. Quite a few of my uncles
were also large capital investors and I had always wanted to get a foot in the
door - so it piqued my interest.

From there I went to meditate in the forest alone for 2 months. Upon
completion, I developed the resolve to become a trader. The goal was to be
able to make 700$ P/M, whilst having time to meditate. At the time I was
living a similar life to a monk, so making a few trades to keep my belly full
was attractive.

‍

**You seem to place a lot of importance on meditation and trading psychology -
can you tell us a bit about why this is so important to you in trading and in
life?**

That's correct. This is because it's completely clear to me that keys control
the trades, the fingers control the keys and the mind controls the fingers.
What distinguishes one person from another from their consistency, learning
style, execution and ability to discern with discretion is the level at which
their mind operates. A lot of people understandably say it's useless, but that
viewpoint is shady to say the least.

‍

**How long have you been trading?  **

Almost six years full time. These days, I trade less and I'm far more in tune
with when to floor the gas or when to trade conservatively. I also have less
of an issue waiting for setups or doubting the quest to sit silent.

‍

**How long did it take you to become profitable?  **

I was profitable from the start - but likely only because I entered during the
beginning of Crypto mania. From my recollection, it was around 1 and a half
years until I had some kind of discretionary method that made sense to me. The
main thing holding me back was not studying my winning setups with enough
depth. I sorted that out by creating a playbook that I reference from time to
time. The other thing was strength in contextual analysis, which transformed
my PNL rapidly.

‍

**Do you have a daily routine?**

My daily routine isn’t ALWAYS the same because life sometimes requires
flexibility. Everyday I work on body speech and mind (exercise, spoken word &
affirmation)

That said, my day consists of hydrating the second I get up, followed by
meditation and breathing exercises. The goal is to lower my heart rate and
develop the ability to pick the thoughts I want to use rather than react to
the thoughts that come.

From there, I’ll take a break and unwind for 30 minutes before I scan the
markets and come up with my plans for the day. These plans must be
crystallised until they have been stress tested, contain multiple variables
and are easily actionable or I don’t move from my desk.

‍

**How long does it take you to formulate these plans? How do you know if
you’re forcing a trade if you won’t leave until you have one?**

I don't force trades very often, because if I do I can feel it. It doesn't
feel right. Plan formulation takes anywhere from 30minutes to 3hrs depending
on how much contextual work I've already done and whether the climate has
shifted since then.

I will also challenge my contextual bias when possible. In this light, the
goal is to be clear so that I can alleviate stress and be certain of my plans
so that I can execute from my phone if necessary. This certainty then offers a
shield against a wholly uncertain craft.

After that, I’ll have high protein meals throughout the day and go to the gym
at some point depending on when I need to execute. I will usually check the
market at even 4hr intervals after I have my strategies in place.

‍

> This certainty then offers a shield against a wholly uncertain craft.

‍

**What's the worst thing about trading?**

That key money-making events are sparse, easy to miss and usually materialise
in extremely small windows (as far as RR asymmetry is concerned). Even if they
take a long time to form - the formation can feel invisible if you’re tracking
it without resetting. So whilst you can to a degree track the market from
compression to expansion, it requires you to be strategically consistent 365
days a year.

Even if I already have a full stomach, failing to capitalise on a key trade or
event in the market by either under-risking, having an incomplete strategy or
missing it entirely is painful for me. It’s a 'catch 22' because whilst it
inspires you to be more diligent if it’s something that is well below your
skill level and you missed it - there is no one else to blame. The sting of
unnecessary failure runs deep.

‍

**Tell us about your most memorable trade?  **

Dumping the BCH Coinbase pump 2017 right at the top. I barely had any capital
back then but it was fairly euphoric for me to fade the crowd in one of the
biggest pump events I’d ever seen. It was also the first confirmation to me
that I have a gift for identifying peak euphoria (to an extent).

‍

**What are some of the signs of euphoria?**

I reference my reactive mind + compare that to social sentiment across social
media. I also track where i believe players are positioned. This is more than
enough.

‍

**What’s the best trading advice you’ve been given?**  

Patience and selectivity is correlated with wealth. It doesn't resonate on a
personal level but rather it is just a simple truth. Deals in life don't come
around often, that's what defines them.

‍

### **Trading:**

**What's the most important quality in a trader?  **

Developing higher levels of awareness and using this awareness to ask better
questions. What you do not know is only what you do not know because…. you
have not pondered it and cannot see it.

This is the skeleton key that opens all doors - but it isn’t the same phrase
as the term ‘trading psychology’. For example, a higher level of awareness
will reveal to you that trading psychology is absolutely useless if you do not
understand how the markets work or your method is poor.

‍

> What you do not know is only what you do not know because…. you have not
> pondered it and cannot see it.

‍

**How _do_ markets work?**

Markets are the sum total of all participant behaviour - retail,
institutional, algo, MM & perhaps brokers or exchanges. All entities are
trying to make money - so where can you slot in?

‍

**Why do you think you have success trading?  **

I’m excellent at reading how the masses move and using confluence to point to
a single conclusion. Wisdom of the crowd is a real thing in the markets
because value is what people want it to be. That said, there is a fine line
between Wisdom of the crowd and the end of reflexivity.

‍

**What's something you've learned in the last 6 months that has made you a
better trader?  **

I’ve known this for a while but my understanding of this is deepening
dramatically. Execution can be solved by developing a feeling of long term
certainty (feeling of success) and then combining this with short term
certainty (planning heavily so that you feel certain you can deal with an
asset like a pro).

Certainty can be improved by understanding probability, and understanding
probability can be improved by understanding why the market moves. With full
recognition that certainty and probability are not entirely correlated.

‍

**Does such heavy planning reduce the number of markets you trade?**

Yes to an extent, but I still trade broadly. I don't like to limit myself.
It's just that the more markets I look at the longer it takes to plan. So be
it.

‍

**What's the mistake you find hardest to avoid when trading?**  

Staying up too late and watching the markets when I should be sleeping. It’s
not worth it, but I do it too often. Still working on it. That or getting
glued to my seat, getting distracted and not walking when I should be. It's
most definitely down to addiction, a drive to be improve or simply tilt.

"your main principle should be to act differently at all times from the
standard model trader" @cryptoshadowoff

‍

**If you could give someone starting trading tomorrow one piece of advice what
would it be?  **

My biggest gift to anyone reading this is to think about the following quote
that I have developed as my own slogan for all of my trading actions
‘Principles Over Paradigms’. Try to understand what it means.

The majority of the industry is a scam and its character (consciously or
unconsciously) is to take your money. Since it is a zero-sum game, the rich
thrive on information asymmetry and execution asymmetry (acting in unique
ways).

Therefore your main principle should be to act differently at all times from
the standard model trader that is taught from easily accessible resources.
It’s not about the method per se, it’s about your edge as far as execution is
concerned.

The second principle is to slow down your time horizons - it takes time to get
wealthy without blowing up. Rome wasn’t built in a day. Steadiness begets
steadiness.

Third, some of the most wealthy people in the game are a product of a lottery
- not skill. Meaning acting in the same way as some of the Crypto kings is a
90% surefire way to lose all your cash.

The fourth principle is you can’t simply pull money out of the market at will,
it gives what it gives.

### ‍**Fill in the blanks**

  * Most traders would be better off using paradigms and not principles
  * What separates the pros from the rest is awareness and experience
  * A good trader should never have wipeout as a potential when risking
  * The biggest misconception about trading is that wonder boys have skill - when in fact they are product of an existential lottery
