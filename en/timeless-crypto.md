@Timeless_crypto is a full-time degen trader based in Australia.

**What attracted you to trading?**

I like the aspect of hunting for my food daily. It is a liberating feeling
knowing I am my own boss and the custodian of my destiny. The game theory
aspect also attracted me. Someone stands to lose while you stand to win - Hawk
vs dove strategies. I like to think the best traders are sharks in a sea of
minnows.

‍

**How long have you been trading?**

I’ve been trading for over 6 years now, but this is my first year going full-
time.

‍

**How long did it take you to become profitable?**

Like many, I’ve blown up a few accounts, but after feeling the pain of taking
an account up in value to see it depreciate to nothing, I started implementing
some structural changes to create a  robust system. I was profitable after
about 2 years of trial and error. The key difference was how I took profits
and mitigated risk. I will say, I had a job during this time and had access to
stable and consistent cash flow. This certainly helps as being capitally
deprived is probably the worst thing for an aspiring trader in my opinion.

**Do you have a daily routine you'd be willing to share?**

Nothing I can share per se, other than I run through my higher time frame
zones of interest and work my way down to the minutia. Asking questions such
as where is the market attempting to go and is it doing an efficient job at
getting there?

I also am a big proponent of exercise and eating healthy as I like to think of
us as soldiers going to war against other participants in the market. Only the
fittest will survive. Mental and physical prowess helps in my opinion.

‍

‍**What's the worst thing about trading?**

It can be a long lonely road. There is no team, there is no feeling of
belonging to a group of others working towards a goal. I worked in an office
for many years and I must say I do miss the communal aspect of my job when I
was at it, but being a trader is to be alone. You are accountable to yourself
at the end of the day. You either made money or you lost and you have nothing
but yourself to fall back on. Once you get this, it is liberating but scary.
Not for everyone.

  

**Would you share with us your most memorable trade? (good or bad)**

Longing the bottom at 30k in July was epic, but calling the intermittent
bottom in September and swing longing 40k to 60k was a real thrill and a crazy
ride. There was a lot of uncertainty in September in traditional markets, but
I laid out chips to play it long and it worked out phenomenally.

  

**WHAT’S THE BEST TRADING ADVICE YOU’VE BEEN GIVEN?**

One bad trade shouldn’t destroy you and one good trade shouldn’t make you.
This is an iterative process of trial and error. Only those that grind will
make it. Hard work, screentime, conviction and self-restraint are ingredients
to make it. My mentor who came from an FX background instilled this work ethic
in me.

**What's the most important quality in a trader?**

Discipline and patience. Knowing when to shoot is crucial. Impatient,
overzealous and impulsive individuals will be crucified by the market.

‍

**Why do you think you have success trading?**

I have an obsessive-compulsive personality. It is either all out or nothing in
my case. I love this game, so I play to win. I work very hard and I put in
hours that most are not willing to do. I also sacrificed many facets of my
personal life to be in the position I am today.

  

**What's something you've learned in the last 6 months that has made you a
better trader?**

Having conviction in a cause is a brilliant weapon of mine, but can also be a
point of weakness. Knowing when to back down is underrated. Staying stubborn
will kill your account. I have learned to back off a lot better this year when
things start to go against the initial thesis.

  

**What's the mistake you find hardest to avoid when trading?**

Like I said, I can be married to my idea sometimes and I used to double down
when things got tight against the grain. I no longer do this. It’s a personal
trait of mine to not back down. That said, the market doesn’t care about me,
so best to back down when things do not go to plan. Opinions are irrelevant,
the chart is everything.

‍

**If you could give someone starting trading tomorrow one piece of advice what
would it be?**

Hard because I wouldn’t recommend trading in the manner in which I do it, but
if you do embark on this path full time, make sure you have insurance and
capital to last a year or more in case things go south. When things go bad
(which is inevitable for everyone starting out), you need to have a nest egg
to fall back on. Being capitally sufficient is something many do not think
about, but is crucial to play this game.  

  
  

#### **FILL IN THE BLANKS**

  * Most traders would be better off **investing.**
  * A good trader should never **risk his entire stack on one trade. It is a game of longevity, not a one-shot trick to get rich.**
  * The biggest misconception about trading is **that it is easy money.**
