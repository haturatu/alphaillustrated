<p><strong>What attracted you to trading?</strong></p>
<p>The game. Something incredibly satisfying in knowing you’re in this huge PvP
battle with some of the smartest minds in the world. The biggest pull was the
fact that the decisions were all mine to make. If I saw a trade, I could take
it, I could make money through my own analysis and thought process. There’s
something incredibly satisfying about that.</p>
<p><strong>How long have you been trading and how have the assets you’ve traded evolved
over time?</strong></p>
<p>I’ll stick with 4 years full time, as I’m loathed to call the time before that
“trading.” From a crypto perspective, I traded ETH solely for a year, scalping
low time frame (LTF) day in and day out. The main feeling then was the lack of
volatility given the period of time we were in from a cycle perspective. It
was really a grind to get the signals. If I missed one of my signals then
typically that was it, no other chances for the rest of the day.</p>
<p>Back then, everyone was trading vs BTC as that’s all there was. Now we have
access to all of these wonderfully volatile USD pairs which provide much more
opportunity for scalping LTF.</p>
<p><strong>You were originally a renko trader when there weren't many around - was this
a challenge or a blessing?</strong></p>
<p>I guess you could say both. It was a challenge because there was no one to
share information with or to discuss the approach in general. But it was a
blessing because it forced me into my own research, interpretation and
adaptation. Overall though probably a blessing, I had no interference or bad
practices that were passed to me.</p>
<p><strong>How long did it take you to become profitable? Were there any significant
turning points for you?</strong></p>
<p>I was profitable from the moment I started trading full time. This was because
I had spent 18 months working on a system and approach to trading and the
results proved that if I simply followed what the system laid out, I’d make
money.</p>
<p>The most difficult aspect of that is removing all of the narrative and noise
that can clutter the decision-making process. Purely acting on “when I have a
signal, press the red or green button” was vital. The “turning point” was
really getting the system working, knowing it was effective and profitable.
Then it was a matter of simply having the discipline to follow it through
thick and thin.</p>

<p><strong>Do you have a daily routine?</strong></p>
<p>Wake up, have coffee, check charts, and leave charts alone unless something
significant has happened. The truth is that given that I operate entirely on a
higher timeframe basis now I don’t spend much time in front of the charts
anymore. I consider myself to be a long term investor in several areas of
crypto but spend less time actively engaging with charts now. No alpha to be
had here unless taking yourself away from the charts is something you need to
do.</p>
<p><strong>What's the worst thing about trading?</strong></p>
<p>I’ll refer specifically to crypto trading here but it’s the 24/7 nature of the
market. It used to crucify me in the scalping days because if I missed that
signal I’d missed my opportunity to make money for the day.</p>
<p>The “always-on” nature of crypto is absolutely punishing and can ruin your
relationships, hobbies and activities in the real world through the addictive
nature of the markets and needing to be glued to the screen.</p>
<p>I’m incredibly grateful I stepped back from that after a couple of years of
relentless grinding. During my time trading equities, you’d have weekends
completely clear, which you don’t really appreciate again until you’ve spent
time trading crypto.</p>
<p><strong>Would you share with us your most memorable trade?</strong></p>
<p>I’ve taken a few that I’d say were memorable - the top at $58k was a really
nice position that I managed to ride through the liquidation sell-off in May.
But the MOST memorable for me was probably MATIC back in 2019. MATIC had been
on a huge run-up, doing ridiculous numbers but I could see it was weakening on
each high it was making.</p>
<p>I decided to take the trade to the short side and hit a huge win when we
capitulated -60% in a day. I even had to contact FTX to try and get me out of
the position because the order book was completely empty.</p>

<p><strong>What’s the best trading advice you’ve been given?</strong></p>
<p>I’ve actually been given very little, preferring instead to develop my own key
points over the years. I’d say that the main thing that I consider is that
risk governs absolutely everything. People say “oh yeah, only lose 1-2% of
your account blah blah” but the reality is that by managing your risk
effectively you can stay in positions longer, worry less about price, be less
inclined to trade based on emotion and small price movements and generally
increase your overall profitability.</p>

<p><strong>How has your view of the market shifted since joining the Haven? How is it
to be part of a team compared to operating solo?</strong></p>
<p>My view hasn’t really changed, I still share my overall higher timeframe
thoughts and focus on trend identification for the future (such as gaming in
Q2 of 2021). Being part of a team is great, we all support each other in
looking after the members and ensuring that someone is always on hand. To be
honest with you, the amount of content the analysts share there is astounding.
It’s non-stop.</p>
<h3><strong>TRADING:</strong></h3>
<p><strong>What's the most important quality in a trader and why?</strong></p>
<p>The ability to accept losses but also at the same time try to improve on your
ability. Understanding that even the best-looking setups and signals can fail,
but also not sitting back and thinking “no worries, that happens when
trading.” Sometimes we can get complacent with losses without striving to
improve.</p>
<p><strong>Why do you think you have success trading?</strong></p>
<p>I put a lot of time in and don’t let outside influence affect me. I cannot
stress enough the impact that Twitter and Discord have on newer traders'
mentality. A lot of people would trade far more effectively if they never
touched social media. They make the right decisions, but when they go online
they let the ramblings of others affect their decision-making process.</p>

<p><strong>Why do you still trade? What does “making it” look like to you?</strong></p>
<p>I will always manage my money. I’m fortunate to now be in a position where I
can just make long term investments, farm and sit back. I’m probably doing 1%
of the total trades I was doing three or four years ago. I changed my style
and process but I’ll continue to grow my money sensibly over time.</p>
<p>In terms of “making it” - I’d say that I’m extremely comfortable with my
current portfolio and lifestyle but I don’t have the drive to push to the next
level. I have two young children and my life priorities are spending as much
time with them as possible. I’m very lucky to be in the position I am, which
enables me to do that.</p>
<p><strong>What's something you've learned in the last six months that has made you a
better trader?</strong></p>
<p>Never fade strength. Never think we’ve moved too much already to get in a
position. Never be the “already pumpedoor.” The best example I can give of
that is AXS.</p>

<p>— COLDBLOODEDSHILLER</p>
<p><strong>You pivoted pretty hard and early into NFTs last year, can you share a bit
about your rationale for doing so?</strong></p>
<p>I’d identified that gaming was going to be a big hit in 2021, I started buying
in Q1 2021, largely because the markets for gaming were setting up to be
incredibly attractive from my system perspective, but also because of the
interest of the participants. My portfolio 20x’d in six months of 2021 because
of that decision.  But that initial dive into gaming was my starting point for
more exploration of NFTs in general.</p>
<p>In February, I purchased my first NFT and really just enjoyed the process so
started exploring it more and more. Once interest levels started rising across
the normies and comparisons were being made to things like Pokemon/Magic/TCGs
from my youth, I realised people understood it.</p>
<p>I saw a golden opportunity to actively trade the space and for a couple of
months, it was the easiest money the market has offered for a long time. I was
in a fortunate position that I bought very strong projects very early and so
when we were reaching peak euphoria I was many multiples up on each purchase.
I managed to time my rotation out of large NFT holdings very well, but still,
own a number of things, either that I love, or that will never sell.</p>
<p>That trend identification is actually one of the proudest moments of my
trading career. It was the first major swing pivot into a trend I’d done with
sizable capital, and it rewarded me beyond anything I thought was imaginable
in that space of time.</p>
<p><strong>What do you look for when shopping for an NFT?</strong></p>
<p>Don’t ever buy copycat projects, see the rise of Azuki now, don’t buy
BabyAzukis, ApeAzukis, whatever other garbage they create, only buy the
original projects. Just look to buy the trending market. The next thing I’d
say is to look for what other people are saying (reputable accounts) - there
typically is a buzz going around and a universal acceptance that a project is
“good.” At the end of the day, the people talking about how good it looks are
also the people you’re potentially going to be selling the project to in the
future.</p>
<p>Lastly, target larger successful projects that have yet to airdrop anything,
most bigger projects have always come with airdrops, they usually offset the
cost of purchase and cause the collection value to skyrocket on the
announcement.</p>
<p><strong>What's the mistake you find hardest to avoid when trading? How do you try
and mitigate it?</strong></p>
<p>FOCUS ON YOU. Ignore Twitter, ignore Discord. Just focus on your trading alone
without outside influence. When you follow other people and let them dictate
your plays you have no personal accountability or points to improve on.</p>
<p>I recommend you just trade what you see, develop your style, understand where
you can be effective and not follow others blindly and give yourself the
option to blame them for why you lost money.</p>
<p><strong>If you could give someone starting trading tomorrow one piece of advice what
would it be?</strong></p>
<p>Don’t do it. Honestly, the majority of people are better investors than they
are traders. Wait for positive market conditions and focus on investment and
rotation around markets.</p>
<p>Oh and TAKE PROFIT. Never feel ashamed, never feel bad about putting real $
back into your wallet.</p>

<p>— COLDBLOODEDSHILLER</p>
<p><strong>You’ve spoken pretty candidly about the addictive side of trading, how did
it manifest for you?</strong></p>
<p>I felt I’d always have to be at a screen, staying on top of the conditions,
trends and shifts of a 24/7 market. If I was out, I’d always be on my phone
researching or checking charts. I was distracted all the time, unable to focus
properly on conversations with so much information spinning around my head.</p>
<p>I started to neglect things I previously loved to do like hobbies and gaming
as I became more and more reclusive. I only wanted to trade.</p>
<p>My wife was working at the time and so she was gone for traditional office
hours in the day, I’d move off my seat maybe twice during that time. I
wouldn’t even do things like eat properly, make coffee, not for any other
reason than time would pass so quickly each day while I was staring at charts.</p>
<p>For me, it was an incredible time of learning, growing my portfolio
substantially and cramming in 16-18 hours a day of active trading or learning.
It’s something I wouldn’t change when I look back because it set me up to be
in the position I am now. However, it’s also something that is not sustainable
and that I would have no intention of ever being involved with again.</p>
<p>Lastly, it’s not for everyone. If I was unprofitable during this time, it
would have been chaos. My addiction stemmed from the fact that I was making
money and wanted to continue to make money, over and over again, as many times
as my system allowed me to. For those people without a system or who are
unprofitable, you won’t survive those periods of active addiction.</p>
